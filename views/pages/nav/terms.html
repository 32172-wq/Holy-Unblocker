            <h4>Holy Unblocker, a private web proxy service.</h4>
          </div>
          <p><strong>Effective Date: 07-16-2021</strong></p>

          <h4>What is Holy Unblocker?</h4>
          <p>
            Holy Unblocker LTS, an experimental web proxy service, can bypass
            web filters or 'blockers' regardless of whether the method of
            censorship is client-side or network-based. This includes the
            potential ability to bypass content blockers overseas, Chrome
            extensions, localized client firewalls, and network-related
            filters.<br />This project serves mostly as a proof of concept for
            the ideal clientless solution to bypassing censorship. Being a
            secure web proxy service, it supports numerous sites while being
            updated frequently and concentrating on detail with design,
            mechanics, and features.
          </p>
          <h4>Is any data being collected?</h4>
          <p>
            Nope! No data is logged or collected by any of our web proxes
            featured. Holy Unblocker values its statement of ending intenet
            censorship along with valuing user privacy.<br /><br />If you wish
            to make a privacy statement or request please contact us via

          <h4 id="Security">Security</h4>
          <p>
            Holy Unblocker LTS is built on cutting-edge technology to ensure a
            secure and reliable web proxy service for its users. One of the core
            technologies behind HU LTS is the new Wisp protocol, developed by
            Mercury Workshop.<br /><br />This protocol brings several innovative
            features and enhancements that contribute to the robustness and
            efficiency of the service.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Wisp protocol is designed to handle modern web traffic demands
            while maintaining high security standards. By implementing Wisp, HU
            LTS leverages the following benefits:
          </p>
          <p>
            Enhanced Performance: The Wisp protocol optimizes data transfer
            speeds, ensuring that users experience minimal latency while
            browsing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Improved Compatibility: Wisp is built to be compatible with a wide
            range of web technologies, ensuring seamless access to various
            websites and online services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Resilience Against Censorship: The protocol is designed to bypass
            sophisticated censorship techniques employed by restrictive
            networks, allowing users to access blocked content with ease.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strong Fingerprint Resistance: HU LTS employs strong fingerprint
            resistance mechanisms within its reverse proxy setup for official
            instances. This means that the proxy is designed to minimize the
            unique identifiers that can be used to track or identify users,
            thereby enhancing privacy. By following industry best practices and
            continually updating its methods, HU LTS ensures that users can
            browse anonymously without leaving identifiable traces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Transparency: Transparency is a key principle for HU LTS. The
            project operates with an open-source model, allowing the community
            to review and contribute to the codebase. This openness not only
            fosters trust but also enables continuous improvement through
            community feedback and collaboration. By adhering to transparent
            practices, HU LTS ensures that users are aware of how their data is
            handled and what measures are in place to protect their privacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            URL Rewriting: HU LTS employs URL rewriting techniques to maintain
            seamless browsing experiences while ensuring that the actual URLs
            accessed remain obfuscated, adding an additional layer of security.
          </p>
          <p>
            Encryption: HU LTS utilizes advanced proxy technologies that focus
            on encryption and secure data transfer, particularly in the context
            of URL rewriting proxies. NOTE: This is still a massive work in
            progress and open to contributions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regular Audits: Conducting regular security audits to identify and
            address potential vulnerabilities.
