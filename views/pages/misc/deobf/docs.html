<p>{{autoMask}}{{Holy Unblocker LTS, an experimental web proxy service, can bypass web filters or "blockers" regardless of whether the method of censorship is client-side or network-based. This includes the potential ability to bypass content blockers overseas, Chrome extensions, localized client firewalls, and network-related filters. The project even allows the ability to browser Tor/Onion sites in any browser!}}</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This website is hosted locally with Scramjet, Ultraviolet (Wisp, Bare-Mux, EpoxyTransport, CurlTransport) and Rammerhead built-in.</p>
<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<h4 id="server-configuration-setup">Server Configuration Setup</h4>
<p>The default place for the proxy when its started is <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, but you can change it if needed in <code>./ecosystem.config.js</code>. You can also modify the other configuration values at <code>./config.json</code>. To clarify you change the PORT and other production metrics via <code>./ecosystem.config.js</code>. Localized changes for source randomization, auto-minify, etc. are located in <code>./config.json</code>.</p>
<h4 id="tor-onion-routing-setup">Tor/Onion Routing Setup</h4>
<p>Simply host Tor using this guide: <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/installation/">https://tb-manual.torproject.org/installation/</a></p>
<p>If you are hosting Holy Unblocker LTS on a VPS utilizing Ubuntu consider attaching Tor to systemctl for easier production management. Once Tor is up and running on either Linux or Windows it will work automatically with Holy Unblocker LTS when enabled by the user via the Settings menu.</p>
<h4 id="proxy-configuration">Proxy Configuration</h4>
<p>The primary location for tweaking any web proxy related settings assigned via the Settings menu is <code>./views/assets/js/register-sw.js</code>. Here you can modify the provided transport options set locally via a cookie, swap out SOCKS5 proxies, change Onion routing ports, specify a blacklist, and more.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>stockSW</code>: The default service worker configuration file for Ultraviolet. For Holy Unblocker however adblocking is automatically enabled so this is not used by default.</li>
<li><code>blacklistSW</code>: A modified version of Ultraviolet that allows for blacklisting domains and adblocking.</li>
<li><code>proxyUrl</code>: Specifies a SOCKS5 protocol URL defaulting to the default Tor proxy port. This can be swapped out with any valid port or SOCK5s proxy.</li>
<li><code>transports</code>: Specifies any provided ports to be swapped via Bare-Mux and utilize Wisp.</li>
<li><code>wispUrl</code>: Modify the pathname or url handling for Wisp</li>
<li><code>defaultMode</code>: Specify the default transport used globally (can be swapped by the users still via the Settings menu)</li>
<li><code>ScramjetController</code>: This constructor allows you to swap out the prefix used for Scramjet dynamically and specify file locations. Note you may need to edit <code>./views/scram/scramjet.sw</code> when changing file names.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="client-navigation-configuration">Client Navigation Configuration</h4>
<p>The primary location for any client side navigation scripts is <code>./views/assets/js/common.js</code>. This file is primary used for Omnibox (Search Engine) functionality, swapping proxy options and linking games. </p>
<ul>
<li><code>getDomain</code>: This constant is used for specifying any subdomains to remove when appending a URL into the omnibox.</li>
<li><code>goFrame</code>: This specifies the stealth frame used for Holy Unblocker LTS</li>
<li><code>sx</code>: This constant specifies the search engine you want to be proxied whenever a user types something in that isn&#39;t a URL</li>
<li><code>search/uvUrl/sjUrl</code>: These functions specify and parse the queries used for submitted URLs</li>
<li><code>RammerheadEncode:</code> This constant is a dependency for Rammerhead parsing and querying</li>
<li><code>urlHandler/asyncUrlHandler</code>: Used to set functions for the goProx object.</li>
<li><code>goProx</code>: This constant allows for the mapping of URL handling for specific proxies, games or links that need to fall under a web proxy.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="lang-js">  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> goProx = Object.freeze({
    ultraviolet: urlHandler(uvUrl),

    scramjet: urlHandler(sjUrl),

    rammerhead: asyncUrlHandler(
      async (url) =&gt; location.origin + (await RammerheadEncode(search(url)))
    ),

    // `location.protocol + <span class="hljs-string">"//"</span> + getDomain()` more like `location.origin`

    examplepath: urlHandler(location.protocol + `//c.${getDomain()}/example/`),

    examplesubdomain: urlHandler(location.protocol + '//c.' + getDomain()),

    example: urlHandler(sjUrl('https://example.com')),
  });
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>prSet</code>: Attaches event listeners using goProx for any buttons or inputs needed</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="lang-js"> <span class="hljs-comment">// prSet function code here....</span>

  <span class="hljs-selector-tag">prSet</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'pr-uv'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'ultraviolet'</span>);

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>huLinks/navLists</code>: Automatically takes paths stated in <code>./views/assets/json</code> and appends them depending on the page and usage. This is used for hiding links that would lead to filter blocks and create an easier system for adding games.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="games-management">Games Management</h4>
<p>As stated above all game links that need to be appended to a page (including images and descriptions) are managed via the nav files in<code>./views/assets/json</code>. When cloning Holy Unblocker utilize <code>--recurse-submodules</code> to ensure all submodules are downloaded along with <code>git submodule init</code>. </p>
<ul>
<li><code>views/archive/g</code>: Contains any local or external HTML5/web games.</li>
<li><code>views/archive/gfiles/flash</code>: Contains Ruffle (an Adobe Flash emulator) and a collection of flash games linked to an external CDN.</li>
<li><code>views/archive/gfiles/rarch</code>: Contains webretro which is a project that ports RetroArch to WASM. Supports many systems like GBA, N64, etc; ROMS are NOT INCLUDED.</li>

<h2 id="future-additions">Future Additions</h2>
<p>This will be our nonexhaustive todo list for Holy Unblocker LTS v6.x.x and above.</p>
<h2 id="code-cleanup">Code Cleanup</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Remove all current obfuscation in the source code. It needs to be dynamically obfuscated if anything, or not obfuscated at all. This option will be a config option on the server side before rendering with Fastify for a performance focus. Meta elements will have an additonal attribute indicating if they should be moved. This is to ensure a SEO source can be served by config or a source focused on pure censorship evasion.</li>
<li>[ ] Optimize the stylesheets and the HTML layout. Add more proper commenting and redivide the code so that it&#39;s less hard on the eyes.</li>
<li>[ ] Optimize the JS. This time it won&#39;t be in one line and will be somewhat thoroughly commented.</li>
<li>[ ] Restructure navigation scripts to ensure updated proxy functionality is sanitized and effective</li>
<li>[x] Particles.js automatically adjusting per display size - done</li>
<li>[x] Fix routes.mjs throwing with incorrect paths - done</li>
<li>[x] Create test script - done</li>

<li>[x] Randomize the __uv$config global, and optionally randomize the UV prefix and URL encoding via cookies</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="proxy-site-functionality">Proxy/Site Functionality</h2>
<ul>
<li>[x] Ensure Ultraviolet is updated to support bare-mux and wisp - done</li>
<li>[x] Ensure Scramjet is added and works together with UV&#39;s implementation - done
= [x] Refactor register-sw.js - done</li>
<li>[x] Add Rammerhead support - done</li>
<li>[x] Fix slow Ultraviolet speeds despite being local; something on the backend?? - done</li>
<li>[x] Fix Ultraviolet on Firefox - (partial/needs work)</li>
<li>[ ] Adapt Applications page to use either Rammerhead or UV (for Reddit, YouTube, Discord)</li>
<li>[x] libcurl, epoxy and all that fun stuff - done</li>
<li>[x] socks5/tor routing option that can be configured (enabled) via either a cookie or pathname as a settings meny option - done</li>
<li>[x] socks5 regional proxy implementation - done</li>
<li>[ ] Update games page content to 10000 games</li>
<li>[ ] Update Applications page to reflect modern fast links (use examples from the modern web proxy base)</li>
<li>[x] Update settings menu again to make more room for more features</li>
<li>[x] Update csel.js (after Setting menu redesign) to support custom transports, icon swap, routing - done</li>

<li>[x] Flesh out and rework the UV / Scramjet / bare client error page - done</li>
<li>[x] Update sw.js to support workerware (<a href="https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/workerware)--">https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/workerware)--</a> This is not done however we have our own middleware system implemented for adblocking, etc. </li>
<li>[ ] Omnibox autoupdate script (for the Google/Bing style auto suggest feature)</li>
<li>[ ] Games library will feature 10000 items; 5000 flash games and 5000 other game types</li>
<li>[ ] Attach proxyvalidatorscript to a status page &gt; have this be served via Fastify, etc. etc; config option disabled as it will cause issues potentially unless if we refactor it slightly.</li>
<li>[ ] Improve adblocking functions on site using AnuraOS standards</li>
<li>[ ] Revamp the Stealth Frame with a slight animation (ease in and then the wheeling loading with a gradient fading away once its loaded or shows the error page LOL), a loading wheel/page and lastly a omnibox widget. It will have like nav buttons, some of the settings from the settings menu, a home button, a button that brings up the Setting menu and be in a designed position.

<h2 id="vague-explanation-for-beginners-with-external-proxies-and-hosting">Vague Explanation for Beginners With External Proxies and Hosting</h2>
<p>You will first want to host your proxies locally or externally. OUTDATED</p>
<h4 id="list-of-some-good-hosting-options-">List of some good hosting options:</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="#">Oracle Cloud</a> (Free, Paid, Dedicated)</li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it">Repl.it</a> (Free)</li>
<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com">Azure</a> (Free and Paid)</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of the list of hosting providers Dedipath and Azure rank first as a preference. You may also self-host.</p>
<p>After you have selected a decent VPS, use Cloudflare for the DNS records for both the site and the subdomains for the proxies.</p>
<p>This is an example of DNS records involving Heroku. Self-hosting will require <code>A records</code> preferably.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Holy-Unblocker/master/views/assets/img/dnssetup.png" width="500"></img></p>
<ul>
<li><code>@</code> and <code>www.example.ml</code> are being used for Holy Unblocker LTS.</li>
<li><code>client.example.ml</code> is being used for other instances like Libreddit or Invidious.</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated previously, Holy Unblocker is hosted locally with Scramjet, Ultraviolet and Rammerhead out of the box. No need for external instances.</p>
<h4 id="freenom-domain-steps">Freenom/Domain Steps</h4>
<p>For beginners, Freenom is a good provider for obtaining domains for free. However, Freenom only provides their TLDs (<code>.cf</code>, <code>.ml</code>, <code>.gq</code>, <code>.ga</code>, and <code>.tk</code>) for free, which can be easily blocked.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get some Freenom domains then add them to your Heroku instance (Personal &gt; [App Name] &gt; Settings &gt; Domains)
Add a domain for both <code>www.example.cf</code> and <code>example.cf</code> with .cf being interchangeable with other Freenom domain names.</li>
<li>If you prefer to obtain premium domains (TLDs) then use <a href="https://porkbun.com">Porkbun</a>, which offers domains for amazing prices. Literally a <code>.net</code> domain normally costs around $10. On Porkbun for the first year it costs $3 so its definitely a deal.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cloudflare-steps">Cloudflare Steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use Cloudflare (make an account), add your site (Freenom Domain or other) and then add your various DNS targets to Cloudflare. Make sure you add Cloudflare&#39;s Nameservers which will be given later when you are adding your site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure they are CNAME although A records also work and try to follow this structure:</p>
<p><strong>Type | Name | Target</strong></p>
<p><code>CNAME | @ | your-main-heroku-target-here.herokudns.com</code><br><code>CNAME | www | your-main-heroku-target-here.herokudns.com</code></p>
<p><strong>Below are if you want external proxies also with your site:</strong></p>
<p><code>CNAME | a | your-womginx-instance-here.herokudns.com</code></p>
<p>Make sure HTTPS is forced and have SSL set to Flexible for some services. Otherwise you can have SSL set to Full.</p>
<h4 id="workspace-configurations">Workspace Configurations</h4>
<p>Preferably if you have your own device use Visual Studio Code. Pretty much the best option you can get but obviously this is an opinion. Also make sure you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a> installed on your machine.</p>
<p>Not going to go too in depth with this part but first fork this repository. The clone it locally through a Terminal of some sort depending on what OS you are on. Make sure you navigate to the folder you want to set this up in.</p>
<pre><code>git <span class="hljs-keyword">clone</span> <span class="hljs-title">https</span>://github.com/QuiteAFancyEmerald/Holy-Unblocker.git

cd Holy-Unblocker

npm install
</code></pre><p>Now simply add the folder you cloned this repo in in VSC. Then run <code>npm install</code>. I recommend that if you are releasing this publically on GitHub that you add a <code>.gitignore</code> in your root directory with the following exclusions:</p>
<pre><code>node_modules
</code></pre><p>Now you have your following workspace environment setup. To deploy the following workspace you just created you will need to look up depending on your hosting provider.</p>
<p>For an online IDE that you can use on your school computer and/or chromebook use GitPod. Basically the equivalent of Visual Studio Code but with in-browser support.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make an account: <code>https://gitpod.io/</code></li>
<li>Fork this repo and enter in this URL to setup your workspace: <code>https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/YourNameHere/Holy-Unblocker/</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Use the same steps above by running <code>npm install</code> in your repository and adding a <code>.gitignore</code> in your root directory specifying to exclude <code>node_modules</code>.</p>

#### Where can I find the games for this repo? (404 errors, etc.)

Due to piracy concerns, size, etc. this has been moved over <a href="https://github.com/QuiteAFancyEmerald/HU-Archive">here</a>. EmuLibrary is not featured in the public version.

<strong>Why is the site I am on not working correctly or having CAPTCHA errors?</strong>

Captcha support is currently not available on all of the current proxies sadly. Therefore some sites may not work with any of the sites. Read below for issues with links on sites.

<strong>I am getting 502 errors. What do I do?</strong>

When this happens you may either switch sites to fix the error or wait a bit. Sometimes clearing your cache can help.

If you still have any questions feel free to ask them in the discord linked here.

<h3 id="why-are-official-domains-now-numbered-is-this-project-maintained-again-">Why are official domains now numbered? Is this project maintained again?</h3>
<p>Yes, this project is active again for LTS support! However, the approach is now much simpler to ensure functionality: traffic will be focused on a single domain. More than ever, this project serves as a proof of concept for the brave souls willing to innovate in the web proxy service space.</p>
<details><summary>Former Closing Message (Original - 2022)</summary>

This isn’t the greatest announcement sorry. After lots of thought and severe hesitation I’m shutting down Holy Unblocker and leaving TN. It&#39;s just been something that I’ve been super conflicted with for months hence the lack of updates and the massive gaps that happened last year. I just didn’t want to throw away a project that I passionately enjoyed and spent time on while making amazing friends and meeting epic devs here. I could go on forever for who these people are but ima like leave it here. They know who they are :D

The main change of thought is that I’m finally just putting an end right now due to 1) the lack of motivation 2) the community is NOT the greatest at time and not the nicest at times (have to put that out here) 3) the future doesn’t look so good for HU/TN as a project.

Some things I’ll be keeping secret since there are more reasons to this choice unless otherwise for those who don’t find this enough information. Good friends here will know that I’ve been super stressed about this choice for months now. Also regardless a good motivator for this choice is the fact that I’ll be graduating soon.

It’s possible that I may continue/come back for this in the future or keep it on GitHub only. I leave this here because even now I am still doubting myself about this change. But for now I’d check out other proxy sites like Incognito (Duce DOES a ton of updates frequently and he is the creator/developer of Ultraviolet so give him some love) :yayy_hopi:

Check out his Patreon also! For current HU patrons you will not be billed next month and the HU Patreon will be archived so head over to Duce’s patron so he can purchase more domains for Incognito.

With love <3
