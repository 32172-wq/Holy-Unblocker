This will be our nonexhaustive todo list for revamping the Holy Unblocker project.

* Code cleanup
  * Remove the timestamps attached to the end of the JS file names.
  * Remove all current obfuscation in the source code. It needs to be dynamically obfuscated if anything, or not obfuscated at all.
  * Optimize the stylesheets and the HTML layout. Add more proper commenting and redivide the code so that it's less hard on the eyes.
  * Optimize the JS. This time it won't be in one line and will be somewhat thoroughly commented.

* Site redesign
  * Landing page - done
  * Web Proxies page
  * Hub pages
